    <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I have been taking professional portraits since 1993... almost 25 years! <br/>I love to be behind the camera and see people smile! Capturing the amazing moments<br/>
                and special times in life is priceless! I offer high quality DVD with edited portraits <br/>
                and a copyright release with all photos! I can also do portraits with 35mm film, <br/>
                if desired (not so common anymore!:). Pictures bring back wonderful memories and are fun<br/>
                to share with family and friends!

                    My Approach
                </h2>
                <p style="color:#d9d9d9;">
                My Goal is to bring out the aspect of the moment, whether it be beauty, goofy, joyful,<br/>       excitement, or something else. I aim to do that because I truly want to capture the moment<br/>
                Instead of taking a picture. I have really enjoyed capturing moments over the years and<br/>
                I have been able to work on many different types of photos. I also try to leave the photos<br/>
                as natural as possible, while still highlighting and capturing the unique details of each<br/> picture.
                No two people have the same eye for art and if you would like something specific to be done<br/>
                In the editing process I am happy to accommodate! I also love natural backgrounds so if<br/>
                you donâ€™t have an idea of where to take your photos, I have some favorite spots that are<br/>
                really spectacular
